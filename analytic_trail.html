    <br>I decided to look into parallel coordinates since it is something we have encountered during the course. My project resulted in a page with a parallel coordinate diagram where you can switch between different categories and see how people in different countries think about that specific area. <br><br>

    <u>Here you can see some examples: </u><br><br>

    <img src="happy.png" id="picture1"><br>
    In this example you can see the result on the question about how happy people think they are.<br> You can hover over the lines to see what country it represent, the country's name will pop up in <br>the corner, the line will also be a bit thicker and also change color from blue to red. <br><br><br>

    <img src="religion.png" id="picture1"><br>
    Here is an example of how it looks like when it is filtered. As you can see the lines that <br>represents the countries that are sorted out are grey and the one that's left are still blue, <br>or red if you hover over it.<br><br><br>

    <img src="family.png" id="picture1"><br>
    If we look into the question about family, it clearly shows that the most countries rate <br>family as very important in their life <br><br><br>
